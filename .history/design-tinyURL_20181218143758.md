# Design Tiny URL

> Ref: https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512

## 1. Why Tiny URL?

Saving space

> TinyURL: https://tiny.com/abcdefg

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirement

- Convert origin URL to tiny URL [len(tiny URL) <= len(origin URL)]
- Convert back Tiny URL to origin URL
- User has expiration time (user could specify)
- User check all tiny URL assgin to him
- User could cutomize the tiny URL address (fixed length ?!)
- User could analyse the accessment of tiny URL
- User could set private or public for assigned tiny URL

### 2.2. Non-Function Requirement

- High availability, otherwise, cannot redirect -> cannot access -> user will no longer access the site.
- Low latency, otherwise, redirect takes long time -> user will no longer access the site.
- High concurrency, otherwise, if many requests, redirect takes long time -> user will no longer access the site.
- Convertion of tiny URL to origin URL should not be predictable.

## 3. Capability

Assumption: 
- Generate 500M new URL per month
- Url redirect request 50 B per month
- Each data rows takes 500 bytes

### 3.1. Traffic (per second)

New URL per second: 

    500M / 30 / 24 / 3600 ~= 200 URLs/s


URL redirect request per second: 

    50B / 30/ 24 / 3600 ~= 20K URLs/s

### 3.2. Bandwidth (per second)

New URL per second:
    
    200 * 500 bytes / 1000 = 100 KB/s

URL redirect request per second: 
    
    20K * 500 bytes / 1000 / 1000 = 10 MB/s


### 3.3. Storage (5 years)

Data rows in 5 years: 

    500M * 12 * 5 * 500 bytes / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 = 15TB


### 3.4. Memory

80:20 rules -- cache 20% of hot URLs

Total URLs per day:

    20K *
